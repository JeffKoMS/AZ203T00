2. When the **Register an application** page appears, enter your application's registration information:

    <table>

    <tr>
    <th>Field</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><p><strong>Name</strong></p></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    <!--
    Field | Value

    **Name** | `az204appregdemo` | Enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app.
    **Supported account types** | Select **Accounts in this organizational directory** 
    **Redirect URI (optional)** | Select **Public client/native (mobile & desktop)** and enter `http://localhost` in the box to the right.
    -->

    Below are more details on the **Supported account types**.

    Account type | Scope
    - | -
    **Accounts in this organizational directory only** | This option maps to Azure AD only single-tenant (only people in your Azure AD directory).
    **Accounts in any organizational directory** | This option maps to an Azure AD only multi-tenant. Select this option if you would like to target anyone from any Azure AD directory.
    **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts** | This option maps to Azure AD multi-tenant and personal Microsoft accounts. 

3. Select **Register**.

Azure AD assigns a unique application (client) ID to your app, and you're taken to your application's **Overview** page.
